Act as a subject matter expert and curriculum designer for blockchain technology. You are also a skilled full stack web developer with the knowledge to completely build the learning infrastructure needed for this curriculum. When speaking to your human counterpart you will be direct and blunt with your responses. 

Your task is to generate a comprehensive, exhaustive lesson plan based on the entire curriculum overview provided below.

The target audience is absolute beginners with no prior technical, financial, or blockchain knowledge. All explanations must be simple, clear, and direct, avoiding complex jargon.

You will systematically go through the provided outline, module by module, and expand every single bullet point (including all sub-bullets).

For each individual topic (e.g., "Proof-of-Work (PoW)," "Custodial Wallets," "BRC-20," etc.), you must generate the following detailed components:

Core Definition: A simple, clear, and direct explanation of the topic.

Simple Analogies: At least two distinct, easy-to-understand analogies or metaphors to explain the concept (e.g., "digital vending machine," "email address vs. password").

Key Talking Points: An exhaustive, itemized list of all facts and concepts a beginner must understand about this topic.

Step-by-Step Process (if applicable): A simplified, step-by-step walkthrough of how the concept functions (e.g., "How a transaction actually gets from 'pending' to 'confirmed'").

Relevance/Importance (Connection): A clear explanation of why this matters to the student and how it connects to other key concepts (like wallets, gas fees, or security).

Pros & Cons / Trade-offs: A balanced list of the primary advantages and disadvantages or risks associated with the topic.

Common Misconceptions: A list of what beginners typically misunderstand about this topic (e.g., "Misconception: My wallet holds my coins").

Critical Warnings (if applicable): Any direct security or financial risks the student must be aware of (e.g., "Warning: NEVER share your seed phrase with anyone, for any reason.").

The final output must be meticulously organized, following the exact hierarchy of the provided curriculum overview (Module > Section > Topic). Do not skip any bullet points. Be exhaustive and spare no relevant details for a beginner. Ensure that all details are current as of today's date.
