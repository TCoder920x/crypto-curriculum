# How to Use This Curriculum

## Using AI as Your Learning Assistant

Throughout this curriculum, you are **strongly encouraged** to use AI tools as learning assistants to enhance your understanding:

### Recommended AI Tools
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) - https://chat.openai.com
- **Google Gemini** - https://gemini.google.com
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - https://claude.ai

### When to Use AI Tools

**✅ DO Use AI For:**
- Explaining concepts you don't understand in simpler terms
- Getting immediate answers to clarifying questions
- Generating additional examples or analogies
- Breaking down complex topics into smaller pieces
- Checking your understanding with practice questions
- Debugging code errors
- Exploring related topics mentioned in lessons

**❌ DON'T Use AI For:**
- Copying answers to assessments without understanding
- Replacing the curriculum content entirely
- Making trading decisions without your own research
- Trusting financial advice blindly
- Avoiding the learning process

### How to Ask Effective Questions

**Poor Question:**
> "What is blockchain?"

**Better Question:**
> "I'm learning about blockchain and the curriculum says it's a 'distributed ledger.' Can you explain what 'distributed' means in this context and give me a real-world analogy?"

**Best Question:**
> "I'm studying Module 1 of a blockchain curriculum. The lesson explains that Proof-of-Work uses mining and Proof-of-Stake uses validators, but I don't understand WHY Proof-of-Stake is more energy efficient. Can you explain the energy difference in simple terms, like I'm explaining it to a friend?"

### Example Prompts for Learning

**Understanding Concepts:**
- "Can you explain [concept] using a different analogy than [curriculum's analogy]?"
- "What's the difference between [concept A] and [concept B]?"
- "I don't understand this part: [paste confusing section]. Can you break it down?"

**Practice and Testing:**
- "Quiz me on [topic] with 5 questions"
- "Is my understanding correct? [explain what you think you learned]"
- "Give me a real-world scenario where I would use [concept]"

**Code Help (Developer Track):**
- "I'm getting this error: [error message]. What does it mean?"
- "Can you explain what this Solidity code does line by line: [paste code]"
- "How would I modify this code to [your goal]?"

### Important Boundaries

⚠️ **Remember:**
- AI tools can make mistakes or provide outdated information
- Always verify technical information with official documentation
- For financial decisions, consult multiple sources and professionals
- AI is a learning aid, not a replacement for understanding
- The curriculum is designed to build foundational knowledge - don't skip ahead

### Collaborative Learning

For the technical portions (Parts 3 & 4), you'll be encouraged to:
- Share your code with classmates for review
- Collaborate on projects and debugging
- Discuss different approaches to problems
- Learn from each other's implementations

# Part 1: The "User" Track (Foundations)

*Goal: To create an informed, safe, and competent user of Web3.*

## Module 1: Blockchain Technology (2h)
- **What is a Ledger?** Defining a centralized ledger (e.g., a bank) vs. a decentralized one.
- **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):** A database shared and synchronized across a network.
- **Immutability:** How records are final and cannot be altered.
- **Consensus Mechanisms:**
    - **Proof-of-Work (PoW):** "Miners" compete to solve a puzzle (e.g., Bitcoin). **Pros:** security, **Cons:** energy.
    - **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** "Validators" lock coins as collateral to be chosen (e.g., Ethereum). **Pros:** efficiency, **Cons:** rich get richer.
    - DPoS (Delegated) and PoA (Authority).
- **Smart Contracts:** "If-This-Then-That" programs that run on the blockchain. *Analogy: A digital vending machine.*

## Module 2: Web3 Wallets & Security (3h)
- **Public Key vs. Private Key:** *Analogy: Public key is your email address; private key is your password.*
- **Types of Wallets:**
    - **Custodial:** A third party holds your keys (e.g., an exchange). **Pros:** easy, **Cons:** "Not your keys, not your coins".
    - **Non-Custodial:** You control your keys.
        - **Hot Wallets:** Software/browser wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
        - **Cold Wallets:** Hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor).

    - **The Problem:** Layer-1s are slow and expensive.
    - **The Solution:** L2s (Rollups, Sidechains). *Analogy: A carpool lane for transactions.*

## Module 4: Tokens & Digital Assets (3h)
> NOTE: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COIN AND A TOKEN…

    - **Ethereum (ERC):** ERC-20 (Fungible), ERC-721 (NFT), ERC-1155 (Hybrid).
    - **Solana (SPL):** A single, flexible program for all token types.
    - **Cardano (Native Assets):** Tokens handled directly by the ledger, not smart contracts.
    - **Bitcoin (BRC-20 & Ordinals):** Experimental standards for creating tokens and NFTs on Bitcoin.
- **Stablecoins:** Tokens pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency (e.g., USDC, USDT).
- **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):**

    - **Definition:** Smart contracts for peer-to-peer swaps (e.g., Uniswap).
    - **Pros:** Non-custodial, no KYC.
    - **Cons:** Gas fees, risk of impermanent loss.
- **Order Types:** Market Order (buy now) vs. Limit Order (buy at a set price).
- **Charting:** TradingView
